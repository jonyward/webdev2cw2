# Web Application Development 2 CW2 Submission

Setup Steps:

npm install

node index

Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ while nothing else is running on this port, in any broswer to access the web application.

This application succesfully populates a nedb database, fetches this data and filters it through a view placing it depending on what menu the data falls under.
Functionality has also been implemented to allow a front end application to add entries to the database as well as being able to update these entries, through 
a staff page, which is only accessible through a login function which authenticates details inputed by the user through another model responsible for login data. Addition and editing of data is only accessible to the user through authenticating a login.
